# Types of Proof

Several types of arguments arise frequently in mathematical proofs.

## Proof by Construction

Many theorems state that a particular type of object exists. One way to prove
such theorem is by demostrating how to construct the object, *proof of construction*.

* *Theorem 0.22*

## Proof by Contradiction

In one common form of an argument, we assume that the theorem is false and then
show that the assumption leads to an obviously false consequence, called a *contradiction*.

## Proof by Induction

This proof is an advanced method used to show that all elements of an infinite set
have a specified property. For example, we may use a proof by induction to show that
an arithmetic expression computes a desired quantity for every assignment to its
variables, or that a program works correctly with all inputs.

Every proof of induction consists of two parts, the **basis** and the **induction step**.
Each part is an individual proof on its own.
