# Automata, Computability, and Complexity

We'll cover three traditional central areas of the theory of computation:

* Automata
* Computability
* Complexity

## Complexity Theory

Researchers have discovered an elegant scheme for classifying problems according
to their computational difficulty. There are several options when comfronting a
problem that appears to be computationally hard.

1. Understand which aspect of the problem is the root of the trouble, then we can
alter the problem.
2. Settle for a "less than perfect" solution.
3. Some problems are hard only in the worst case situation, but easy most of the
time.

Depending on the application, we may be satisfied by a procedure that is
occasionally slow, but runs quickly most of the time. Lastly, we may consider
alternative types of computations, such as randomized computation, that could
speed up certain tasks.

Crytography is a field that is directly affected by complexity theory. This field
is different becayse it specifically requires computational problems that are hard,
instead of easy.

## Computability Theory

First half of the 20th century, some big name mathematicians discovered that certain
basic problems could not be solved by computers:

* Kurt Godel
* Alan Turing
* Alonzo Church

Theories of computability and complexity are closely related. In complexity theory,
the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones; whereas in computability
theory, the classification of problems is by those that are solvable and those that are
not. Computability theory introduces several of the concepts used in coplexity theory.

## Automata Theory

Automata theory accounts for definitions and properties of mathematical models of
computation, which play a role in several applied areas of computer science. Models
include *finite automaton* - used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design -
and *context-free grammar* - used in programming languages and artificial intelligence.

Automata theory is a great place to begin the study of the theory of computation.
Computability and complexity theories require a precise definition of a *computer*.
Automata theory allows practive with formal definitions of computation as it
introduces concepts relevant to other nontheoretical areass of computer science.
