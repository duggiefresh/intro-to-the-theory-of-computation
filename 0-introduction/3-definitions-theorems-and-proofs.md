# Definitions, Theorems, and Proofs

**Definitions** describe the objects and notions that we use. A definition can be
simple or complex. When defining an object, be sure to make clear what constitutes
that object and what does not. After defining objects and notions, we usually make
*mathematical statements* about them.

**Proofs** are convincing logical arguments that show a statement is true.

A **theorem** is a mathematical statement proved true. **Lemmas** are statements
that help in the proof of another, more significant statement. **Corollaries**
are theories that help us to easily conclude related statements.

## Finding Proofs

The only way to determine the truth or falsity of a mathematical statement
is with a mathematical proof.
